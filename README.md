 Peri-Op Medicine Prescribing Guidance
This project began at #gashack at the Royal College of Anaesthetists in October 2017. It is essentially a free tool that allows anyone to search for a drug by name and get the relevant instructions for administration in the peri-operative period.
There is a live demo here :

We require further input to refine the more complex drug instructions e.g. insulin and anti-thrombotics. We also need to include stuff like timing of limb and neuraxial blocks in relation to anti-thrombotics.
I have excluded the back-end management system and the libraries for sending mail (PHPMailer) and creating PDFs (FPDF).
These are freely available.
